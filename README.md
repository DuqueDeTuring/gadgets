# gadgets

A repo to keep track of interesting gadgets and toys that I find or someone
tells me about. These are things that I might own already, desperately am
waiting to be released, or want in the future.

    looking hardware design.

    gaming.

    playing old game cartridges. Awesome hardware design.
